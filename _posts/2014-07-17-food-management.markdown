# *Expierence*
I am currently a Manager at my family's resturaunt, Pizza Town. My tasks are to ensure employees, and customers are happy. On the job, you can catch me filling in whenever a cook needs a break, helping with payroll, checking inventory, and ordering inventory. I also help run our social media pages.
