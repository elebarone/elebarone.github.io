    <title type="html">Eleano Barone Portfolio</title>
  

  
    <subtitle>Hello! My name is Eleano Barone, I&apos;m majoring in Software Engineering and Economics at Allegheny College. I am fascinated on how code can shape the future and make everyday tasks easier. This is exactly what I want to do, and I am excited to dive deeper into both fields. Being fluent in Italian and English also helps me see things from different perspectives, and I am always looking forward to learning from and working with others who share my passion. I am confident that this path is where I am meant to be, and I cannot wait to take on challenges along the way!.</subtitle>
